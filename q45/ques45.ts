//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.


type car={
    manufacture :string,
    model:string,
    [key:string]:any
}
function carParts(manufacture:string,model:string,option:Record<string,any>):car{
    return{
        manufacture,
        model,
       ...option
        
    }
   

}
const mycar:car= carParts("Honda","Civics",{color:"black", year:2000})
console.log(mycar);
