//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


       let members: string [] = ['Umar','Fatima','Kainat','Saba','Areeba'];

        let message: string = "would you like to learn phython?"

        console.log(members[0]+" "+ message );

        console.log(members[2]+" "+ message);

        console.log(members[3]+" "+ message);

        console.log(members[4]+" "+ message);

        console.log(members[1]+" "+message);
