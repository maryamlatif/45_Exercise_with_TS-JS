//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var transports = ["Honda Bike", "Civics", "BMW", "Honda city"];
transports.map(function (item) { return console.log("I Would Like To Buy A", item); });
