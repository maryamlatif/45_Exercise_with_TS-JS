/*Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

let car = 'subaru';

console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

console.log(car == 'subaru')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.*/

//Making a variable

let five = 5;
let seven = 7;

//5 tests evaluate to True

// Test 1
console.log("Five is equal to 5?");
console.log(five == 5);

//Test 2
console.log("\nSeven is equal to 7?");
console.log(seven == 7);

//Test 3
console.log("\nFive is not equal to seven");
console.log(five != seven);

//Test 4
console.log("\n 7 is  greater then 5");
console.log(7 > 5);

//Test 5
console.log("\n 5 is  smaller then 7");
console.log(5 < 7);

// 5 tests evaluate to False

// Test 6
console.log("\n Five is equal to 3?");
console.log(five == 3);

//Test 7
console.log("\nSeven is not equal to 7?");
console.log(seven != 7);

//Test 8
console.log("\nFive is equal to seven");
console.log(five == seven);

//Test 9
console.log("\n 5 is  greater then 7");
console.log(7 < 5);

//Test 10
console.log("\n 7 is  smaller then 5");
console.log(5 > 7);
